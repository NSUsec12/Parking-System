6. Enhances the visitorâ€™s experience.\\

\section{Modules:-}

\section*{a)Data Records}\vspace{1.0cm}\\

\section*{Staff records:-}\\

 It helps to provide details of staff that uses the Vehicle parking management
System. It provides the descriptions of staffs like:\vspace{1.0cm}\\
 
-Staff first, middle and last name\\
